# 03 JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker

# Payroll-Check

## Challenge Goal
It is to modify the starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data.

## What I learned
I learned that I need to promp user for employee details.

I needed to manipulate the DOM to implement the functionability required by the challenge goal.

I have to be careful with the loop in my 'collectEmployees' function or it may cause some issues such as showing only one employee name.

I need to return the array.

A unique title is required.
